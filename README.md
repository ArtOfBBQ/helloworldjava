# helloworldjava
One of my other mini-projects, ASTROR, represents graphics with Polygon as coordinates of points to be connected.

This Java app allows me to draw out a design and gives me the coordinates, so I can paste it into the ASTROR source and
have a more funny/interesting design for my asteroids and space ships.

- Left click the screen to add a polygon point
- Left click a polygon point, then click anywhere else to move that polygon point
- Right click a point to delete it
- When you're done, the coordinates will be in your clipboard
